The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.1. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition-problems-health-concerns'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '6.1.0', found versions: 5.0.1 (from hl7.fhir.us.core#5.0.1), 6.1.0 (from hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0). Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition-problems-health-concerns' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition-problems-health-concerns|6.1.0'

# We are using FHIR R4 for this profile so this warning is not relivant 
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
